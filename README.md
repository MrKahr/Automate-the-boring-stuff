This is a repository of different little hobby projects inspired by Automate The Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart. 
The projects so far include: 
- A rock paper scissors programme 
- A Collatz Sequence 
- A simpler Collatz Sequence
- Comma Code
- My own list converter (not part of the book, just something I wanted to play around with).
